Notebooks in the main directory contain the code to reproduce the molecular examples (np junction model and ethylene chain). These notebooks are supported by code in /systems/ and /tools/, as well as data in /logs/

pbc/ contains the code to reproduce periodic examples (hydrogen chain, polyactetylene, and NiO)
